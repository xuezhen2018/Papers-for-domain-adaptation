# Feature Adaptation

[1] ICML2018, CyCADA: Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Domain Adaptation, Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03213.
Main features: This paper combines feature adaptation with pixel adaptation, using CycleGAN as an example for pixel adaptation. Note that in this paper, pixel adaptation only is better than feature adaptation only. 

(Pixel adaptation can be implemented by any paired or unpaired image generation networks or style transfer networks. The main idea is to transfer source images into images that are content-consistent with source images and style-consistent with target images.)
