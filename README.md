This repository contains the papers that I've read and recommended for anyone else working in domain adaptation.

# Feature Adaptation

[1] ICML2018, CyCADA: Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Domain Adaptation, Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03213.
Main features: This paper combines feature adaptation with pixel adaptation, using CycleGAN as an example for pixel adaptation. Note that in this paper, pixel adaptation only is better than feature adaptation only.

[2] CVPR2018, Learning to Adapt Structured Output Space for Semantic Segmentation, Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.10349.
